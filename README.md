gamepad-flat-icons
==================

This is a free set of flat icons that can be used in any of your game dev projects - commercial or non-commercial.

This repository contains the source file that the icon set is built from. If you want to download a ready to use set, then head over to the release page on Itch.io.


Naming Convention
-----------------
Each file starts with a prefix of `generic_`, `ps_`, `xb_` or `switch_` denoting generic icons, PlayStation icons, Xbox icons and Nintendo Switch icons respectively. They are then followed by the name of the button the icon represents and end with a DPI indicator of either `50`, `96`, `150` or `300`.

Resolutions
-----------
All the icons have a consistent width and height with the exception of the icons representing the shoulder buttons (L1, LB, L) and the generic start and select buttons. These icons, instead, have a width consistent with the rest of the icons, but heights that are unique to them; allowing for consistent horizontal spacing with the rest of the icon set.

The resolution of the icons for each DPI are as folows:

- 50dpi: `44x44` (`44x23` for the exceptions listed above)
- 96dpi:  `84x84` (`84x45` for the exceptions listed above)
- 150dpi: `132x132` (`132x70` for the exceptions listed above)
- 300dpi: `264x264` (`264x139` for the exceptions listed above)

Building from Source
--------------------
To build the icons from the source SVG file, [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) must be installed and available in your global path. When setup, open a terminal in the source directory and run the `build.sh` script. An icon set exported at 50, 96, 150 and 300dpi will be exported into the `build` directory.
